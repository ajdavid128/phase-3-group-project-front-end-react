# THE ARCHIVE

THE ARCHIVE was created in 1 week by Flatiron School Software Engineering Students, Aaron David & Leah Cardoz, for their Phase 3 Project.

THE ARCHIVE is a React & Ruby application showcasing screenprint artists and their prints where users can submit their favorite artists and artwork.

The focus of this project is building a Sinatra API backend that uses Active Record to access and persist data in a database, which will be used by a separate React frontend that interacts with the database via the API.

Users are able to:
- View a timed slideshow of all of the prints on the Home page.
- See all artists on the Artists page and add a new artist by submitting a form.
- Click on an artist card on the Artists page to view their detail page and their associated prints.
- On an artist's detail page- add a new print by submitting a form, update an existing print's category tags, or delete an existing print.
- View a gallery of all print images with info about each print on the Gallery page.
